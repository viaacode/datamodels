A file may (or may not) be a container containing zero or more files of various formats. File formats may be defined by a specification, or by a reference software system. Many file formats exist in forms with minor variations, and many also in more than one version. Typing of file formats should be interpreted generously rather than strictly, but sufficiently precisely to distinguish versions where such distinctions have significant interpretive consequences."@en ;

        <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment>  "The PRONOM Persistent Unique Identifier (PUID) is an extensible scheme for providing persistent, unique and unambiguous identifiers for records in the PRONOM registry. Such identifiers are fundamental to the exchange and management of digital objects, by allowing human or automated user agents to unambiguously identify, and share that identification of, the representation information required to support access to an object. A PUID is assigned on entry to PRONOM, and every identifier is unique within the namespace, and is persistently and unambiguously bound to a single registry entry. The PUID type element identifies the type of registry entry; for a file format it is fmt or x-fmt; for a character encoding it is chr or x-chr; for a compression encoding it is cmp or x-cmp; for a software package it is sfw or x-sfw. The integer value that follows is the identifier element and denotes an instance of that type within PRONOM.\r\nThe x-puid is a legacy form of the PRONOM Persistent Unique Identifier (PUID) originally intended as a temporary identifier to assign to records until a judgment could be made about the validity of the entry; if the entry was deemed to be a valid entry then a standard PUID was meant to replace the X-PUID on an entry. Many collections have been characterised using X-PUIDs and for this reason existing X-PUIDs are still maintained but will not be assigned to any new entries."@en ;

Not all formats have an associated MIME type, but this is specified where it is known. MIME is an acronym for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is written to allow MIME to be extended in certain ways, without having to revise the standard.

        <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment>  "A file extension is a suffix to the name of a computer file applied to indicate the type of file format. It gives a human readable identifier for the file; such that users can quickly understand the type of file it is without having to open it. The filename extension associates the file with certain software packages, helping an application program recognise whether it is of a type that it can work with. In some operating systems, such as DOS, a file extension is required, but in others, such as Unix, it is optional. Some operating systems limit the length of the extension and some are case sensitive. On Windows computers, extensions consist of a dot '.' at the end of a file name, typically followed by three letters to identify the type of file. On a Unix based system, the file name is a single string, with the '.' being just another character, and with the file name being of variable-length. A file extension is not a reliable identifier of the format of the file. An extension may be linked to more than one program; they are not assigned by a controlling authority, and can be easily changed."@en ;
